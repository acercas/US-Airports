## Topic

Major US Airport Passenger Traffic in 2016 (Domestic vs International)

## Analysis
<p>The initial idea stemmed from trying to find a topic around data that I knew was readily available and knew where to find it. Being a frequent traveler and an aviation fan I knew that airports keep records and logs on the streams of passengers and cargo that pass through them. I began by determing the busiest airports in the United States in 2016, choosing last year instead of the current year simply because not all the data has come in yet and wanted a fully represented data set to work with.  
<br>The busiest airports in the US are consistently Atlanta, New York's JFK, Los Angele's LAX and Chicago's Ohare airport. What becomes interesting however is the break down of where those passengers are flying from and to. Some airports have extreme fluctuations in passenger traffic that flies to and from domestic destinations versus their international reach. For example the most extreme are New York's Laguardia airport and Washington D.C's Ronald Reagan airports. Their overall total passenger totals are 29 and 23 million respectively. However when you count their total international passenger traffic it is a fraction of their yearly total, Laguardia only handeled 1 million passengersm and DC's Ronald Reagon saw even fewer, with only 300 thousand. However, both these airports run in tandem with their larger international airport counterparts and are primary means of relieving congested airport hubs and cities that move a lot of passengers.
